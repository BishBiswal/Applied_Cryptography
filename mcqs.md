1: n = 35; e = 5; C = 10. What is the plaintext (use RSA) ?
 
 C=m^e mod n
 10=m^5 %35
 m=5
 
 2: p = 17; q = 31; M = 2 find Cipher text.
 
 N=p*q=527
 f(n)=16*30=480
 
 C=m^e mod N
   =2^65537 mod 527
   
    In the RSA algorithm, we select 2 random large values ‘p’ and ‘q’. ‘p’ and ‘q’ should have large random values which are both prime numbers.
    
    In RSA, we select a value ‘e’ such that it lies between 1 and Ф(n) and it is relatively prime to Ф(n).
    gcd(e, Ф(n))=1; and 1 < e < Ф(n).
    
    7. For p = 11 and q = 19 and choose e=17. Apply RSA algorithm where message=5 and find the cipher text.
    N=11*19=209
    fn(18*10=180
    
    (e*d) mod f(n)=1;
    17* mod 180=1
    d=53
    C=m^d %N
     5^53 %209=199 Answer
