# Kerckhoffs's Principle
Kerckhoffs's principle revolutionized the way we think about cryptography. It states that we should allow the attacker to know everything about a crypto implementation, except the key. If a cryptosystem can stand up to that level of scrutiny it will be the better for it.

# Avalanche effect
A small change in plaintext results in the very great change in the ciphertext.(diffusion)

# Completeness
Each bit of ciphertext depends on many bits of plaintext. (confusion)
# S-box
Symmeric key alogorithm
if input is N bits , O/p can be Mbits
An intermediate stage of encryption/decryption .. used in DES.
Function that maps input to o/p can be defined by a table which is pre defined.
